                    any financial, legal, technical, or other decisions involving the Services, you 
                    should seek independent professional advice from a licensed and qualified

                    It is important to understand that neither we nor any affiliated entity is a party to any
                    transaction on
                    the blockchain networks underlying the Kromatika Protocol; we do not have possession, custody or

                    when
                    you interact with any Kromatika Protocol smart contracts, you retain control over your cryptoassets
                    at
                    all times. The private key associated with the wallet address from which you transfer cryptoassets
                    or
                    the private key associated is the only private key that can control the cryptoassets you transfer
                    into
                    the smart contracts. You alone are responsible for securing your private keys. We do not have access
                    to
                    your private keys. Due to the non-custodial and decentralized nature of the technology, we are not
                    intermediaries, agents, advisors, or custodians, and we do not have a fiduciary relationship or
                    obligation to you regarding any other decisions or activities that you affect when using our
                    Services.
                    You acknowledge that we, for the avoidance of doubt, do not have any information regarding any
                    users,
                    users’ identities, or services beyond what is available or obtainable publicly via the blockchain.
                    We
                    are not responsible for any activities you engage in when using Services, and you should understand

                    The Kromatika Protocol is deployed on multiple blockchain-based networks, and we are not responsible
                    for
                    the operation of such networks.
                </h2>
                <p> The software underlying blockchain networks on which the Kromatika Protocol is deployed, including,
                    for
                    example, the Ethereum blockchain, is open source, which means that anyone can use, utilize, and
                    build on
                    top of it. By using the Services, you acknowledge and agree (i) that we are not responsible for the
                    operation of the blockchain-based software and networks underlying the Kromatika Protocol, (ii) that
                    there exists no guarantee of the functionality, security, or availability of that software and
                    networks,
                    and (iii) that the underlying blockchain-based networks are subject to sudden changes in operating
                    rules, such as those commonly referred to as “forks”.
                </p>

                <h2>Transactions on the blockchain are not anonymous.</h2>
                <p>A widespread belief is that transactions involving blockchains are anonymous. In fact, a central
                    feature
                    of blockchains and thus, blockchain-based transactions, are that they are transparent. Your public
                    key
                    and your wallet address, which you need to buy or sell items on the blockchain, are visible to
                    anyone.
                    To the extent your public key or wallet address can be linked back to you, it would be possible for
                    someone to determine your identity and the cryptoassets you own.
                </p>

                <h2>There may be associated blockchain fees.</h2>
                <p>All transactions using blockchains require the payment of gas fees, which are essentially transaction
                    fees paid on every transaction that occurs on the selected blockchain network. Please note that gas
                    fees
                    are non-refundable. We do not provide any services to users or deliver, hold, and/or receive payment
                    for
                    cryptoassets. We do not receive any fees for any transactions, the Services, or the Site.

                <h1>3.Assumption of Risk</h1>
                <p>You assume the risks of engaging in transactions that rely on smart contracts and other experimental 
                    technology.
                </p>

                <p>Transactions on the Kromatika Protocol rely on smart contracts stored on various blockchains,
                    cryptographic tokens generated by the smart contracts, and other nascent software, applications and
                    systems that interact with blockchain-based networks. These technologies are experimental,
                    speculative,
                    inherently risky, and subject to change. Among other risks, bugs, malfunctions, cyberattacks, or
                    changes
                    to the applicable blockchain (e.g., forks) could disrupt these technologies and even result in a
                    total
                    loss of cryptoassets, their market value, or digital funds. You are solely responsible for the
                    safekeeping of the private key associated with the blockchain address used to interact with the
                    Protocol. We assume no liability or responsibility for any such risks. If you are not comfortable
                    assuming these risks, you should not access or engage in transactions using blockchain-based
                    technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the other defining features of blockchain technology is that its entries are immutable, which
                    means, as a technical matter, they generally cannot be deleted or modified by anyone. This includes
                    smart contracts and cryptoassets generated and programmed by smart contracts. THUS, TRANSACTIONS
                    RECORDED ON THE BLOCKCHAIN, INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF CRYPTOASSETS AND DATA PROGRAMMED INTO THESE

                    (SUCH AS REVENUE AND INTEREST ALLOCATIONS), MUST BE TREATED AS PERMANENT AND CANNOT BE UNDONE BY US

                    TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT AND TO HAVE A JURY HEAR YOUR CLAIMS. IT CONTAINS PROCEDURES FOR MANDATORY

                <p>Agreement to Attempt to Resolve Disputes Through Good Faith Negotiations</p>
                <p>
                    Prior to commencing any legal proceeding against us of any kind, including an arbitration as set
                    forth
                    below, you and we agree that we will attempt to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy between
                    us
                    arising out of or relating to the agreement or the Services (each, a “Dispute” and, collectively,
                    “Disputes”) by engaging in good faith negotiations. Such good faith negotiations require, at a
                    minimum,
                    that the aggrieved party provide a written notice to the other party specifying the nature and
                    details
                    of the Dispute. The party receiving such notice shall have thirty (30) days to respond to the
                    notice.
                    Within sixty (60) days after the aggrieved party sent the initial notice, the parties shall meet and
                    confer in good faith by videoconference, or by telephone, to try to resolve the Dispute. If the
                    parties
                    are unable to resolve the Dispute within ninety (90) days after the aggrieved party sent the initial
                    notice, the parties may agree to mediate their Dispute, or either party may submit the Dispute to
                    arbitration as set forth below.

                <p>Agreement to Arbitrate</p>
                <p>
                    You and we agree that any Dispute that cannot be resolved through the procedures set forth above
                    will be
                    resolved through binding arbitration in accordance with the International Arbitration Rules of the
